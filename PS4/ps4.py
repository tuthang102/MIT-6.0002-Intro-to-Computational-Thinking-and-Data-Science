# Some simple questions about the plots

    # 1.What happens to the total population before introducing the antibiotic?
    #     Sim A: The total population increases then converges
    #     Sim B: The population increases then decreases
    # 2.What happens to the resistant bacteria population before introducing the antibiotic?
    #     Sim A: Increase then decrease
    #     Sim B: Increase then decrease
    # 3.What happens to the total population after introducing the antibiotic?
    #     Sim A: Abruptly drop then slightly increase.It tends to converge
    #     Sim B: Abruptly drop and decrease to zero
    # 4.What happens to the resistant bacteria population after introducing the antibiotic?
    #     Sim A: Slightly increase then converge
    #     Sim B: Rapidly decrease to zeo
